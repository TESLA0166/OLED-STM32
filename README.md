# OLED-STM32
this project contains library files and cube-mx settings for running OLED display with stm32.
works with both i2c and spi protocol you can choose whatever you want.
use #define SSD1306_USE_SPI  in first of ssd1306.h and ssd1306.c to use spi mode  
and do the same thing  and write #define SSD1306_USE_I2C to use i2c mode
it works 100 percent correct and is tested
enjoy!
